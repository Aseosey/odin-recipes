    <img src="../images/spanish-omelette.jpeg" alt ="spanish-omelette">
    <p>The Spanish omelette, known as "Tortilla Espa√±ola," is a classic Spanish dish made with eggs, potatoes, onions, and olive oil. Slices of potatoes and onions are fried until tender, then mixed with beaten eggs and cooked in a skillet until it forms a thick, round omelette. It's a staple dish in Spanish cuisine, often served as a tapa or a light meal.</p>

    <h2><strong><u>Ingredients:</u></strong></h2>
